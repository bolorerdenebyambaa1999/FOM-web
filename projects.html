                <h2>About our scholarship</h2>
                <p>
                    The Friends of Mongolia Scholarship Program was established in the spring of 2006 and has since grown to better serve the community.  Our program targets applicants from rural areas with high academic potential and financial need who want to attend university in Mongolia.  In the 2013-2014 school year, Friends of Mongolia helped 19 students attend university.
                    <br>
                    For rural families struggling to make ends meet, the prospect of sending a child to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar to attend university can be out of reach.  Friends of Mongolia scholarships are provided on an annual basis, and students may apply to have their scholarships renewed if they have kept up with the academic requirements.  We underwrite all or nearly all of each student's tuition, depending on the tuition rates of the student's university.  Throughout the academic year, we provide extra activities to help with our students' development. Past activities include career development lectures and English language lessons for students.

                <h2>Matthew Girvin Scholarship Fund</h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our scholarships are given under the Matthew Girvin Scholarship Fund, managed by Innovia Foundation.  https://innovia.org/our_stories/scholarship-fund-opens-the-path-to-college-for-underprivileged-mongolian-students/
                    <br>
                    This fund was created in memory of Matthew Girvin, a UNICEF program officer who worked for the development of Mongolia's children, health, and future.  Matthew was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in Mongolia in January of 2001.  UNICEF established a scholarship in Matthew's honor in 2003, and in 2006 Friends of Mongolia began administering the scholarship.  Our organization is honored to be able to have the chance to assist Girvin family with this important scholarship, and we look forward to working with them to honor Matthew's legacy for years to come.  You can find out more about Matthew Girvin and the fund at the <a href="https://www.matthewgirvin.org/">Matthew Girvin Scholarship</a> website.

                <h2>Other Scholarship Funds</h2>
                <p>
                    Friends of Mongolia has also administered scholarships sponsored by members and donors.  For the 2013-2014 academic year, the Croft Family Scholarships enabled students from the Gobi desert to attend university in the capital.  In the past, groups have also joined together to underwrite one or more scholarships.  If you are interested in funding a scholarship, you can do so on our <a href="membership.html">Donation Webpage</a>, or you can email treasurer@friendsofmongolia.org or codirector.usa@friendsofmongolia.org

                <h2>Scholarship History</h2>
                <p>
                    When our scholarship program was first formed, it was open to young male students.  The reason for this unique requirement was what is referred to as "Mongolia's reverse gender gap" in education.  Often, rural males are left behind in education because of social and economic demands in the countryside.  As the scholarship has grown significantly it is now open to all genders, with emphasis for students with financial hardships otherwise unable to afford college.

                <h2>About CDGs</h2>
                <p>
                    The Friends of Mongolia Community Development Grant program provides financing for small community-based projects in Mongolia and the United States that further education, cultural exchange, and community development between both countries.  These grants provide a small amount of funding that can go a long way do to things like repair a school, start market gardens, upgrade a community IT center, and support women in small businesses.
                    <br>
                    Community projects generally do not attract the kind of funding on offer from large multi-lateral or bi-lateral donors, and modest community-based programs struggle to find appropriate funding to support their program goals. The FOM Community Development Grant program is intended to address these issues. This program was inspired by the Small Project Assistance (SPA) grant program that has been used by many Peace Corps Volunteers to help their communities.  The Friends of Mongolia grant program began in 2006 with a grant to the National Center Against Violence and a 2007 grant to the Gobi Radio Project. All FOM Community Development Grants are community initiated and implemented.

                <h2>Apply for a Grant</h2>
                <p>
                    Proposals are accepted during the application period, and each proposal is reviewed by a committee made up of Friends of Mongolia Members using a standard scoring method.  Final funding approval for proposals is made based on review committee recommendations and the availability of funds. Each proposal should demonstrate community-based support for a project through a minimum 25% local in-kind contribution of labor and materials to the overall budget of the project. While there is no limit for how much an application can request, historically Friends of Mongolia has awarded grants of $1000 or less, as to approve as many proposals as possible.

                <p>
                    One of Friends of Mongolia's goals is to reach out and educate as many as possible about the beautiful country and people of Mongolia. We take this extra step because we believe that through this education and outreach, invaluable understanding and relationships are built between our two great countries.  While this is a small portion of our budget, it allows our outreach events to have a wide reach.If you have a great idea for a potential outreach opportunity, let us know at admin@friendsofmongolia.org.
