            <h2>Why join as a member?</h2>
            <p>Membership in not-for-profit organization such as Friends of Mongolia, first and foremost, is a way of making a donation. It is another way for a non-profit to ensure a stream of revenue that can make our programs possible.
                <br>
                When you become a member, one of the first things you get is the satisfaction of donating to a cause you believe in. The second benefit is being counted among a community of people who share your interests and have a similar social consciousness. The third is rights to contribute to the governance of the organization by nominating and electing members of the board of directors and officers, as well as proposing amendments to the bylaws and voting on those amendments. The fourth is additional perks such as newsletters, discounted rates on services, and recognition in official publications. Friends of Mongolia strives to offer its members all four benefits of being a member, and it continuously is on the look out for other benefits that encourage people to contribute to our mission.</p>
