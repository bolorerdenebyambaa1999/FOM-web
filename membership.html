        <h2>Why join as a member?</h2>
        <p>
          Membership in not-for-profit organization such as Friends of Mongolia,
          first and foremost, is a way of making a donation. It is another way
          for a non-profit to ensure a stream of revenue that can make our
          programs possible.
          <br />
          When you become a member, one of the first things you get is the
          satisfaction of donating to a cause you believe in. The second benefit
          is being counted among a community of people who share your interests
          and have a similar social consciousness. The third is rights to
          contribute to the governance of the organization by nominating and
          electing members of the board of directors and officers, as well as
          proposing amendments to the bylaws and voting on those amendments. The
          fourth is additional perks such as newsletters, discounted rates on
          services, and recognition in official publications. Friends of
          Mongolia strives to offer its members all four benefits of being a
          member, and it continuously is on the look out for other benefits that
          encourage people to contribute to our mission.
        </p>
